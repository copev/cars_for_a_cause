        <h2 >How do I become a sponser?</h2>

        <p>On Saturday, July 25th Cars for a Cause will be holding a charity car show to generate proceeds for the Canadian Mental Health Association – Windsor Essex. We would like to invite your company to join us as a sponsor for the event.
                There are two options available for sponsorship of the event detailed below<br>

                Option 1 – Raffle Prize Donation<br>
                There will be a number of prizes to be raffled off during the event that are donated by event sponsors.  These prizes can be a product or service provided by your company or an item donated on behalf of your company (gift cards, electronics, automotive products or services).  Tickets for raffle prizes will be sold in two groups; prizes valued at less than $175 and more than $175.
                *Raffle prizes will be picked up by Monday, July 20th<br>

                Option 2 – Award Sponsorship<br>
                We will be presenting awards at the show for different classifications (Best in Show, Best Exotic, Best Domestic, etc.).  Choosing this option of sponsorship will put your company’s name on the award that will be presented at the end of the show.  We also invite you to attend the presentation of the award to the winner for that classification.  The cost for this option is $175 and will cover the cost of the award as well as engraving of your company name. The number of available awards is limited.
                *To allow time for engraving the awards payment is due Monday, June 29th<br>

                If you or your business are interested in sponsoring the event we would love to hear back from you to finalize details.  You can reach out by call or text to either Paul Sulja at 519-919-7165 or Philip Klimski at 226-344-1490 or by email to carsforacausewindsor@gmail.com.</p>
