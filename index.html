        <h2 >Who We Are</h2>
        <p class='description'>Cars for a Cause was started in 2019 after the loss of a close family member and friend that was struggling with his mental health.  We saw an opportunity to turn a negative situation into something positive. With so many members of the car community struggling with their mental health we wanted to do something to raise awareness.  This is when we decided to start organizing our first event to generate proceeds for the Canadian Mental Health Association while also giving people an outlet to talk to someone, or simply see they are not alone.  After seeing how successful our first event was we want to continue bringing the car community together for more causes.</p>
