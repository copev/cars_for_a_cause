            <p tabindex="0">Cars for a Cause was started in 2019 after the loss of a close family member and friend that was struggling with his mental health.  We saw an opportunity to turn a tragedy into something positive. With so many members of the car community struggling with their mental health we wanted to do something to help raise awareness. </p> 
                <p>This is when we decided to start organizing our first event to generate proceeds for the Canadian Mental Health Association while also giving people an outlet to talk to someone, or simply see they are not alone.  After seeing the success of our first event we wanted to continue bringing the car community together to help more local non-profit organizations.</p>

            <p>Mental Health in the car scene has always been an afterthought in the minds of car enthusiasts. Traditionally, car clubs and car shows were mainly male-oriented, 
                and membersâ€™ mental health was rarely brought up or discussed. Today, the car scene has expanded and progressed, 
                with an almost equal amount of people from all backgrounds and ages. However, the stigma behind mental health still exists, especially in our Windsor-Essex area.</p>
                    <p>The decision to partner with CMHA Windsor-Essex started with the idea to help promote mental health resources and services in the local car community. 
                    With the help of CMHA, Windsor-Essex enthusiasts could have better access to support when they need it. Sometimes when your car and friends cannot be there for you, it can get lonely. 
                    Sometimes it can even be depressing. With the help from CMHA and the support of the car community, Cars for a Cause believes that every car enthusiast has the power within to make an impact in their own lives.<br>
