All cars that enter the show are eligible to win an award as long as your placard is clearly displayed.
                Spectators can also participate in the voting process. We will have voting cards available at the registration table for a monetary donation of your choice.  We encourage all attendees to participate in selecting the winners of the awards.

            <h3>Cars for a Cause - Canadian Mental Health Association - Windsor Essex - 2019</h3>

            <p>On July 20th, 2019 Cars for a Cause hosted our first ever event thanks to the help of our many sponsors. This event was a car show that allowed many of Windsor’s car enthusiasts to get together and compete for various prizes, including Best in Show and Best Domestic. Because of the organizers’ involvement in the Windsor car enthusiast scene, word about the event spread quickly and people quickly began responding to the event. The first Cars for a Cause car show was held at Parks & Rec Gastropub from noon to 5:00pm. There was something for everyone as all attendees were able to win raffle prizes regardless of if they entered a car in the show. The generosity of many local vendors was full on display as they donated various prizes to support the cause.</p>

            <p>Our sponsors helped us put together some incredible prizes to be won, which included over $3000 in gift cards, an epoxy floor, detailing packages, and much more. It was amazing to see the community and local vendors come together to support an important cause that needs more attention. The event saw over 250 cars attend and $11,125.25 raised for the Canadian Mental Health Association.</p>

            <p>The success of this event showed us just how well the car community as a whole could come together for an important cause.  The feedback from the first Cars for a Cause car show was overwhelmingly positive and, combined with how well everyone came together to support the cause, it motivated us to continue on with these types of events to benefit various causes in the future. Using the feedback and positive support we received for our initial event, our goal is to use that success to put on future events and help out even more charitable organizations.</p>
