            <h3>Cars for a Cause - Canadian Mental Health Association - Windsor Essex - 2019</h3>
            <p>On July 20th, 2019 Cars for a Cause hosted our first ever event thanks to the help of our many sponsors.  It was held at Parks & Rec Gastropub from noon to 5:00pm with many raffle prizes and awards to be won as well as a Low Car Limbo hosted by RicerGang.<br>
            Our sponsors helped us put together some incredible prizes to be won which included over $3000 in gift cards, an Epoxy Floor, Detailing Packages, and much more. The event saw over 250 cars attend and $11,125.25 raised for the Canadian Mental Health Association.<br>
            The success of this event showed us just how well the car community as a whole could come together for an important cause.  This motivated us to continue on with these types of events to benefit various causes in the future.</p>
