        <h2>So what's the story?</h2>

        <h2 class='intro'>Paul Sulja</h2>

        <p class='description'>After losing his cousin that struggled with mental health in early 2019, Paul Sulja wanted to find a way to turn something negative into a positive.  Being a car enthusiast his entire life Paul wanted to find a way to bring the car community together while raising awareness for a cause that hit so close to home.  This was when he started Cars for a Cause; a group of car enthusiasts bringing the community together for the benefit of others.<br>
        Paul will also be adding more information but as of yet he has not written anything else *eye twitch*</p>

        <h2 class='intro'>Phil Klimski</h2>
        <p class='description'>Phil Klimski is a 22 year old car enthusiast, born and raised in Windsor. He grew up around cars from a young age, visiting car shows and dreaming about one day being able to drive and own his very own.<br>
        In 2019, he decided to join the Cars for a Cause team with the vision to turn local car shows into something more than just enthusiasts meeting up to talk about builds and “how much horsepower” is being made under the hood. He realized that although cars can be used as a means to de-stress and escape, the mental health stigma was evident and was often overlooked by local enthusiasts.<br>
        Today, Phil continues to focus on his own health, both physically and mentally while helping others to do the same. He is very excited to grow the cause and support any Windsor-Essex non-profit organization.<br>
        “Even if only one person reaches out to get help, that is enough of a reason to keep me doing what I do. Donations are very helpful, but the best kind of help is what you can do for yourself, with the encouragement of your peers.”	</p>
